# Hotel-Management-using-Client-ID

The idea and purpose of this project is to make a Hotel Management system using Client ID. We have implemented our project using various concepts of OOP. We have tried our best to make the code as efficient as possible. The objectives of this project were to extend the concepts of Object-Oriented Programming to real world activities, in this case Hotel Management. This project helps in easy creation and searching process for client IDs and books hotel rooms, restaurants, and banquet halls. The objectives were fulfilled by learning the concepts of object oriented programming and the fundamentals of C++ throughout the course of four months, simultaneously studying research papers about exception handling, object oriented design, some algorithms and learning C++ programming language, which improved our skills of problem solving, fixing bugs, problems and errors, creating our own algorithms while gaining experience of working in a team.
